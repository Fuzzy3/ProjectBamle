# ProjectBamle

Android Project - Todo-list app

Bamle is an app that is going to help you get your duties or tasks done.
When you remember something that has to be done, you add to a list of todo's in bamle.
Every morning you will be asked which todo's you want to do today, and select them.
The app will then remind you when you still have tasks to complete today.

Version 0.1 is in progress...
